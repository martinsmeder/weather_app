A browser based weather app powered by GiphyAPI, weatherAPI and webpack.

Some things I've learned:

- How to manipulate and render data from APIs
- How to perform asynchronous operations using async/await syntax
- How to enable multi-file-debugging via source maps in webpack
- How to setup multiple entry points in webpack
- How to separate DOM-rendering and app-flow into different modules/objects
